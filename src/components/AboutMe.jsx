    <p>My name is Kelci Atkinson, and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer student in T5. My favorite languages to work with are Python/Flask and I enjoy working with HTML and CSS. When I graduate I'd love to find a Front End Developer job and work on games with my partner. My non school hobbies include embroidery, board games, and decorating in the Sims.</p>
